# HiPR-FISH Spatial Mapping of Cheese Rind Microbial Communities 
# :cheese: :microscope: :world_map:

[HiPR-FISH spatial imaging](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2983-4) was used to look at the distribution of microbes within five distinct microbial communities growing on the surface of aged washed rind cheeses (link to pub doi). HiPR-FISH was performed by [Kanvas Biosciences](https://www.kanvasbio.com). Imaging data and spatial correlation data is available at (zenodo link). 

This respository contains the data and code used to visualize the spatial correlation of microbes across the combined five cheese dataset.
