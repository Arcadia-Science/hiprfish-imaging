# HiPR-FISH Spatial Mapping of Cheese Rind Microbial Communities 
# :cheese: :microscope: :world_map:

[HiPR-FISH spatial imaging](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2983-4) was used to look at the distribution of microbes within five distinct microbial communities growing on the surface of aged washed rind cheeses. HiPR-FISH was performed by [Kanvas Biosciences](https://www.kanvasbio.com). Imaging data and spatial correlation data is available [here] (https://zenodo.org/record/7613703). Check out the full [pub] (https://doi.org/10.57844/arcadia-0zvp-xz86).

This respository contains the data and code used to visualize the spatial correlation of microbes across the combined five cheese dataset.
